<span style="font-size:medium;">Many students, third year in specific, asked me about how to write the C.V. to apply for summer trainings and internships?</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">First let me state that there is no right or wrong way to write your C.V. but there are some facts, DOs, and DON’Ts that don't change.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">Some facts to state first:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">C.V. will not get you an internship or training, it will just get you an interview.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">C.V. represents you ! Take Care.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">The difference between resume and C.V. is explained </span><a href="http://jobsearch.about.com/cs/curriculumvitae/f/cvresume.htm"><span style="font-size:medium;">here</span></a><span style="font-size:medium;">, but forget about it, most people think they are the same <img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/e/338" alt="" />.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">C.V.s are read in 10 seconds, if the reader didn’t find what he is looking for, He won’t continue reading it.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Never ever exceed two pages.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size:medium;">Now to the DOs</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>1- Know your recipient:</strong></span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">Big and medium size companies like LinkDev, ITWorx, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, IBM, Facebook …etc have a recruiter and HR department, which means that the first person to read your C.V. is not (very) technical, and follows something like a standard procedure to scan your C.V. and filter it based on a criteria determined by the company, like GPA/grade, Number of activities, Number of coding projects with a specific programming language related to the job, and other filters.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">Small companies where the number of employees ranges between 3 – 40 don’t have HR department nor recruiters, and here the person reads you C.V. is either the manager/owner of the company, or the person you are going to work with. Mostly those people are overloaded because they already have another job to do and therefore they need your C.V. to be very clear and concise.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;font-size:medium;"><strong>2- Objective:</strong></span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">The Objective is simply, What do you want to be in five years?  without mentioning the statement, “in five years.” I don’t know why people have to write objective, but as I know, HRs love it, and technical people don’t care about it.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">Objective must be attractive, and related to the job, and I prefer objectives contains fabulous words.</span>

<span style="color:#f79646;font-size:medium;">Seeking a challenging, great …. bla bla bla, in a great good know international corporation …bla bla bla … to increase and develop my skills in ….</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Don’t:</span> Apply for a company and write that your objective is to be the manager of that company, or your objective is to have your own company, because this means why would we accept you and at the end you open your company ?</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>3- Education:</strong></span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">All you have to write is your university, please don’t mention your school, because you don’t want a second of your ten seconds wasted in knowing your secondary school. You have to state clearly the Grade (Good, Very Good, Excellent) or GPA, and if you are ranked on your department or class please write your rank.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">One of the tricks I saw and it is recommended if you have a very low grade, is to write your education after activities, technical skills and experience, because if your experience and skills are high, they won’t care about your grade.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">Don’t list courses you studied, because I saw many people doing this and this is not useful at all. Sometimes you may want to list the 2~4 main courses, so that the company know what you can do and what you can't.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">Also remember to explain your GPA system briefly (e.g. GPA 3.?/4.0) because there are different universities that give GPA out of 5, and even inverts the scale (0.0/4.0 is the highest GPA).</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>4- Experience:</strong></span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">Write all experiences sorted in a chronological order from newest to oldest.</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Trainings/Internships</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Company Name internship/training: your position, your role, what you did?, when was this (June 2010 to July 2010).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Competitions/Contests</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Imagine Cup (Which competition, passed rounds, project description, and your role in the project).</span></li>

	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">IEEE.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Google Code Jam (rank over Egypt, and passed rounds).</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">ThinkQuest.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Any other contest with achievement.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Projects you participated in. (Non Academic projects)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>5- Activities:</strong></span>
<ul>

	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">IEEE Student Branch</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">LVAD</span></li>

	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Vision</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">STP</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">TE</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Courses you delivered, or you were an assistant.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Any other activity.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size:medium;">You have to mention your role in each activity you participated in, and a very brief description about the activity itself. Sort them in the most important first order.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>6- Technical Skills:</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Programming Languages</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Operating Systems</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">Databases</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:medium;">IDEs/Tools.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Don't</span> lie, if you write that you are good at something, they may ask you in it.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;">Be clever, if you are applying to Microsoft, maybe they will not care if you know Java well, so put it in the end of the list.</span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>7- Languages:</strong></span>
