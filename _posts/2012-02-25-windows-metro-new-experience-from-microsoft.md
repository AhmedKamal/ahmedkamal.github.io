Hi , In this post I want to talk about the new operating system from Microsoft.  When I read about Windows 8 and how it can change our thoughts about OS , I decided to test this new operating system to be able to make a full opinion about it. So I opened Google and searched for it until I found the download links for different versions and then I installed it.

<span style="color:#000080;">You can download it from this link</span>

<span style="color:#000080;"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516</a></span>

When you open it you will find two main versions available for downloading

1- <span style="color:#ff0000;">Windows Developer Preview with developer tools</span>

It is for developers who may want to develop applications (Metro Style Apps) using Visual Studio 11 and Expression Blend 5

2- <span style="color:#ff0000;">Windows Developer Preview</span>

It is for the normal user who only wants to test the new features in this new OS

One of the best things in this OS is that it is different from any Windows before. You will notice that from your first look after installing it. Also it supports ARM architecture and this is fantastic advantage that I will talk about later.

I have made a simple video about how you can install windows developer preview in your machine if you have win 7 or win xp. The video is in Arabic.
