<p>Hi , these days I’m trying to improve my skills in ASP.Net as I have a project that needs some server side language coding. I want to share some information with you about <font color="#ff0000">“Razor Syntax”. <font color="#000000">I didn’t write the next paragraph but I only collected it from ASP.NET official site. By the way it is very nice and will help you a lot if you want to learn ASP.Net.</font>&nbsp;</font></p> <h5>The Razor Syntax, Server Code, and ASP.NET</h5> <p>Razor syntax is a simple programming syntax for embedding server-based code in a web page. In a web page that uses the Razor syntax, there are two kinds of content: client content and server code. Client content is the stuff you're used to in web pages: HTML markup (elements), style information such as CSS, maybe some client script such as JavaScript, and plain text. <p>Razor syntax lets you add server code to this client content. If there's server code in the page, the server runs that code first, before it sends the page to the browser. By running on the server, the code can perform tasks that can be a lot more complex to do using client content alone, like accessing server-based databases. Most importantly, server code can dynamically create client content — it can generate HTML markup or other content on the fly and then send it to the browser along with any static HTML that the page might contain. From the browser's perspective, client content that's generated by your server code is no different than any other client content. As you've already seen, the server code that's required is quite simple. <p>ASP.NET web pages that include the Razor syntax have a special file extension (<em>.cshtml</em> or <em>.vbhtml</em>). The server recognizes these extensions, runs the code that's marked with Razor syntax, and then sends the page to the browser. <h5>Where does ASP.NET fit in?</h5> <p>Razor syntax is based on a technology from Microsoft called ASP.NET, which in turn is based on the Microsoft .NET Framework. The.NET Framework is a big, comprehensive programming framework from Microsoft for developing virtually any type of computer application. ASP.NET is the part of the .NET Framework that's specifically designed for creating web applications. Developers have used ASP.NET to create many of the largest and highest-traffic websites in the world. (Any time you see the file-name extension <em>.aspx</em> as part of the URL in a site, you'll know that the site was written using ASP.NET.) <p>The Razor syntax gives you all the power of ASP.NET, but using a simplified syntax that's easier to learn if you're a beginner and that makes you more productive if you're an expert. Even though this syntax is simple to use, its family relationship to ASP.NET and the .NET Framework means that as your websites become more sophisticated, you have the power of the larger frameworks available to you. <p><img alt="Razor-Img8" src="http://i1.asp.net/umbraco-beta-media/38815/Razor_programmingintro-8.jpg"> <p>Thanks for Reading&nbsp; :) <p>Ahmed Kamal
