<p>Hello guys , today I want to share part of what I gained from attending Nokia Smart Asha Event this week. It was a cool event and I benefited a lot from attending indeed. The whole event was about the new full touch phones that Nokia are going to sell here in Egypt in the next few months. They are good smart devices with all the features you may need and the surprise is that its prices are between 600 - 900 LE (100 $ - 150 $). I think this is too suitable as you can't get these features (Camera , Sensors like GPS , Acceleramator , Orientation in addiiton to OVI Store which would provide you with high quality apps like those in Android and IOS ).</p><p> </p><p> </p>
